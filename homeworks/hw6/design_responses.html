					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that any animation shorter than 100 ms is instantaneous and won't be recognized at all.
								I didn't know that we won't be able to register this movement. It is interesting how an animation
							longer than 1 second would convey a sense of delay as well. 1 second doesn't seem that long, but it is in reality.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article were the animated diagrams. It was fascinating being able
								to see different aspects like position and duration being changed in real time. It was also cool seeing the good
							and bad versions of the animation. It puts into perspective what makes human-centered design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Quote: "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

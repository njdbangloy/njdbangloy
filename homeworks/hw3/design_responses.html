						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the age of your audience can affect
								what font you choose. I also learned about font pairing
							and how they are just as important as the font themselves. Another
						thing I learned was that you should use the Perfect Fourth instead of using the golden ratio.
					I also learned that creating a typography styleguide is good. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was about what color you should use. I learned to choose
								colors for the type that harmonizes with the color palette. It was
							interesting to see how other copmanies use their typography guidelines. It makes sense and portrays them in a certain way. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

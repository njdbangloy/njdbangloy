        Hello! I'm Nevin, a data science student at UC Berkeley. 
        I enjoy binging shows on Netflix and making food spontaneously with friends. 
        I also like beating people in Street Fighter and trying out different restaurants.
        These are three of my favorite places to eat in Berkeley:

    <ul>
        <li>Noodle Dynasty</li>
        <li>Toss Noodle Bar</li>
        <li>La Burrita</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Something I learned from this article is that it is easier to focus on components of apps when they're deconstructed. 
            I realized that I didn't recognize many of the details and that I usually just glaze over them while using the app normally. Now I see how they
            incorporated hierarchy, content, intent, and audience to make the app appealing for users.

        <li>My favorite part of this article is that the author also didn't start off as a product design prodigy. It 
            is good to know that I am not alone. I don't have much experience, but I'm eager to learn. I enjoyed
            hearing their perspective and background.

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p>Reddit Original</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframeb4.jpg"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p>Reddit Redesigned</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframenew.jpg"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the Reddit website is to provide a platform for users to share and discuss various topics in the form of comments or posts. It is intended for a diverse audience, catering to anyone interested in talking with other members in a community setting. Reddit's design accomplishes this by offering an interface to scroll through subreddits, upvote, downvote, and post comments.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> My redesign of the Reddit website addressed the crowded feeling of their homepage. Visitors are bombareded with multiple icons, buttons, and posts. It now has more whitespace since I removed some extra icons/buttons, allowing users to breathe and understand what they are viewing.   </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>

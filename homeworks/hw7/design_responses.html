							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about Gestalt. It is a group of visual perception principles developed
								by German psychologists in the 1920s. It is built on the theory that "an
								organized whole, is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts". </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was their example with the clouds. I do look into the sky
								and notice unusually shaped clouds resembling familiar objects. It's cool to learn that it is because of
							how our brain works.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

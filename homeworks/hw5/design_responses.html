                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article, I learned that we can create a lot of really cool animations. There are
                                so many complex and creative transitions and transformations. I also learned about
                            more ways to interact with the interfaces. It is way different from websites that I am used to using. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article is seeing all the different visuals. Everyone has unique ideas
                                that I never thought was possible. It is cool seeing their visions brought to life. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite was the "Add to Cart" interaction. It is so crisp and intuitive. I like how they used the Nike brand to showcase
                                its capabilities. It showed how easy to use and approachable it is. This interface acheived its goal because
                                it makes buying shoes way more accessible and easy. 
                            </p>

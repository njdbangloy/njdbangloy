				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something that I learned from this article is that dark patterns are deceptive in user experience interactions. 
							They are designed to mislead or trick users to make them do something they don't want to do.
						I did not know about this. This is meant to generate mroe sales, get subscriptions, and hit target numbers
					in transactions.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article is seeing the dark patterns in the past and in modern day. 
							It was cool to see how they evolved with modern times. They referenced many examples that I 
						have experienced before. They were very intrusive. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> Quote: "If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another."</p>
					</li>
